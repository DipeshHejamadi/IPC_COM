Verify Shared Memory: Ensure that the shared memory segments are created and accessible. You can use tools like ipcs (on Unix-based systems) to inspect shared memory segments.

Error Handling: Test various scenarios, such as registering multiple services, querying for non-existent services, and checking how your system handles errors.

Concurrency: If your setup involves concurrent access, test with multiple instances of client applications to see how well your system handles simultaneous service registrations and queries.
